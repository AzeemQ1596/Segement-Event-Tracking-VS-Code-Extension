## How to use Seca:

**Step 1)** To track all Segment events - Command/Ctrl + shift + P, then look for Segment: Track Events

After this a snippet file is created where users can easily reuse code. They can simple type in your code the name of the event, type and it will show you all the snippets that match. This command will also create a .json file that stores all Segment events.

**Step 2)** To show Segment Even Table - Command/Ctrl + shift + p, then look for Segment: Show Segment Report

This will open up another tab where a table is generated where users can see at a glance all of the Segment events in their code. Users can search for each field and also double-click each any row and it will open the file and the line that the code is located.

**Refreshing:**

Every time you add you wish to update your code, you can use just Command/Ctrl + shift + P, then look for Segment: Track Events to refresh the .json file with the new events

## Features

This is a VS Code extension for users of Segment. This will help track Segment events that are in the user's code and display information about line number, file name and event type.

The extension reads the users file, extracts lines where Segment events are called and saves it in a file. Information like line number, file name and type of event are also stored. From this file we create a webview that can be viewed insdie of the VS Code IDE. The file created also allows for code reusibility as it allows for creating custom snippets, making it easier to reuse previous code
